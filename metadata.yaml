abstract: "Cross-validation is the gold standard for evaluating machine learning
algorithms or fine-tuning their parameters.
The results of this technique, however, are not always reproducible and may
depend on the computing platform and the number of parallel threads,
especially if the underlying learning algorithm uses a pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG). This paper gives a recipe for solving these reproducibility problems and
applies it to LIBLINEAR, a popular software library
that implements randomized learning algorithms based on support vector
machines. The proposed approach solves these
problems by using a cross-platform PRNG and by making the PRNG state private
in each thread. The cross-validation results obtained with the modified
version of LIBLINEAR were the same across platforms. Furthermore, the
parallelized cross-validation results were no longer affected by random
fluctuations arising from the sharing of the PRNG state by parallel threads."
